## Attendance
Punctuality is one of the most respected virtues in the industry. If you have a reputation for showing up on time, you will always find people willing to trust you and to hire you. Use this class as an opportunity to build the habit of punctuality. It will be very difficult for you to learn the material if you are not in class. If you must come in late, please be respectful of the class and try not to disturb anyone as you enter. If you know ahead of time that you will be late or absent, please contact me before the start of class so we can arrange for you to make up material you will be missing.

Please refer to the latest student handbook for the university-wide policy on attendance.
