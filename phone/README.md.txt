The main goal of this game is to input a numeric code in the correct order. The player is given two clues. The first clue is an email that has no numeric values but mentions a password in alphabetic letters. The second clue is a cipher. This cipher is a chart where a letter is given a numeric value. The player solves this puzzle when they use the alphabetic phrase in the first clue and translate it into a numeric code with the second clue. This game has standardized that the game will use 10 digit codes as the victory condition.

The original game had the ability to randomize it's code, however the randomize feature was removed to reduce confusion in the game and among the development team.
